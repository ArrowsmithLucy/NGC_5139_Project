About:
This is a study of Omega Centauri (O Cen) where we use telescope images from Monash University's Hutton-Westfold Observatory, and is a project for computational astrophysics.

The aim of this project is the determine the age, colour and distance of O Cen using aperture photometry. 
The code in the project uses python, Jupyter Notebook file type, and requires the download and access to the images in the image folder. 

A PDF copy of the final report is included for analysis of the code.
